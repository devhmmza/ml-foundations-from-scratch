# ML Foundations From Scratch

> Learning Machine Learning the **right way**: from first principles, understanding how models learn, why they fail, and how to debug them — all implemented in **pure Python**, no external libraries.

This repository is part of my **year-long BSAI roadmap (2026)**, focused on mastering Machine Learning and building industry-ready skills through **hands-on projects, visualizations, and practical experimentation**.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

Most students learn ML through libraries and tutorials. While that’s useful, I wanted to **see inside the model**, understand:

- How predictions are generated  
- How models learn by adjusting parameters  
- How bias, variance, and data issues affect performance  

Every project here emphasizes **understanding the learning process, coding from scratch, and linking concepts to real-world scenarios**.

## 📚 Core Learning Goals

- Understand the **ML pipeline**:
- Observe **how models learn**: the training loop (guess → measure error → adjust → repeat)
- Explore **model failure modes**: overfitting, underfitting, bias vs variance
- Build **linear & logistic regression from scratch**
- Connect **theory to code** and visualize learning
- Prepare for **main projects and mini-projects** in my 2026 roadmap
